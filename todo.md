## To do

This list contains outstanding suggestions / non-critical issues identified in previously merged pull requests. The following items do need to be addressed in due time.

- [ ] Revisit customEvent to potentially be scoped to the search-ui element instead of document
- [ ] Move QS generic integration to GCWeb (JS & CSS)
- [ ] Add Expected output on test pages (HTML) and use Jekyll highlights
- [ ] Leverage wb core features instead of reinving the wheel, such as for language of page and dates.
- [ ] Optional: Make IDs configurable for "suggestion", "result-list", "result-link", "query-summary", "pager"
